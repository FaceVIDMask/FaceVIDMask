With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become essential to wear a mask and maintain proper distance to avoid the transmission of the virus from one person to another. However, various applications such as facial recognition systems face difficulties in performing their job efficiently. Hence, Our work proposes a facial recognition system using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) that can accurately recognize a person irrespective of whether they are wearing a mask or not and can also determine if the person is violating social distancing norms. Given the importance of wearing a mask, the proposed system also performs mask detection using VGG-19 and Haar Casacade classifiers. Metrics used to evaluate the proposed system include accuracy, precision and recall.
